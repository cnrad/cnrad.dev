      I recently stumbled across a video on YouTube entitled{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGpBQgZ5IsI">
        Liber Indigo - Metaphysical Prisoners of the Desktop
      </a>{" "}
      that piqued my interest. In it, the idea is presented that perhaps the way
      we interact with computers is a prison of our own making.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, I've been toying around with the idea of a different approach
      entirely to interfacing with computers. Why are we limited to a folder and
      file directory? How else can we interact without a mouse and keyboard?
    </p>

    <p>
      In this article, I'll be exploring some of these ideas and how they might
      look and behave - and you'll be able interact with simple prototypes of
      these ideas right here in the article!

    <p>
      The idea of layers - different layers of an interface divided into a
      couple categories: - read - edit
      <br />
      <br />
      The idea of a "map" - locations are no longer objectively folder based,
      but the user understands their computer in "locations"
