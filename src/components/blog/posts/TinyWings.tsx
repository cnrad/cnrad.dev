    <p>
      This new product called the iPhone just released and will probably change
      the future of smartphones forever. You can view media, text and make
      calls, and browse the internet - all from one device in the palm of your
      hand.

      Fast forward a bit - it&apos;s 2008. Apple just released this thing called
      the App Store where you can download other apps that anyone can choose to
      create. There&apos;s even a couple games to play when you need to pass the
      time!
